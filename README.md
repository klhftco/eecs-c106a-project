# Robotic Manipulation of Objects with Different Properties via Tactile Sensing

We developed a planning scheme for estimating different objects' rigiity and performing pick and place tasks using Universal Robots' UR5 Arm, Robotiq 2F-140 Gripper, and an ATI Axia80 Force/Torque Sensor. This project was done in collaboration with:
- Daniel Tan
- Frank Fan
- Japinder Narula
- Katherine Yuen
